using InteractiveGMT

# Two tiers of tests:
#   * :unit / :fast  — pure-Julia helpers (colour, CPT, packing, basemap pixel math, the scene-state
#                      parser). No DLL, run anywhere `using InteractiveGMT` works. Always run.
#   * :gui           — scenario tests that open REAL Qt+VTK windows through the built gmtvtk.dll and
#                      assert scene state via gmtvtk_scene_state. Opt in with INTERACTIVEGMT_TEST_GUI=1
#                      (add QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen for a headless attempt). Skipped by default so
#                      CI / a DLL-less checkout still passes.
# Tolerant of how cmd/PowerShell mangle the value: strip surrounding quotes and whitespace
# (`set VAR="1"` keeps the quotes; `set VAR=1 && ...` keeps a trailing space). Also honour
# `Pkg.test(test_args=["gui"])`, which forwards "gui" into ARGS reliably across the subprocess.
